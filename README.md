This is a git Repository for gogossing with safety.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main purpose of this project is to ensure the safety of a person who drives a shared Kickboard. 

The main functions are below.

1) If the driver doesn't wear a helmet or more than one person are on board, Kickboard doesn't work. When if a driver takes off his helmet while driving, the speed gradually decreases and eventually stops.
2) If the Kickboard detects an an object close to the front while driving, it slows down a little.
3) If the Kickboard falls down while driving, an alarm sound is activated or a gps value is transmitted to an acquaintance of the driver to get help.
